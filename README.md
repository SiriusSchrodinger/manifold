# Variational Auto-encoder from Manifold Valued Data
<p>train.py,spd.py,model.py show an encoding and decoding neural network consisting of 2D convolution decoding layers and Cayley Map based decoding layers. This new model aims to minimize the reconstruction loss between input and output manifold data.<p>
